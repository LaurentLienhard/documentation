# Deployment

When all requirements done (installed), you need to deploy the backend.

For that, couple steps:

* get the release version, available on our [github repository](https://github.com/fusionSuite/backend/releases).
* get the last version and the file with *.tar.gz* extension
* extract the archive into your webserver folder
